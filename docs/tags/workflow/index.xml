      <description>A phenomenon has puzzled me for quite some time when I started my career as a bioinformatician, that is to say, everyone knows the benefits of workflow systems, everyone has heard of and talks about the power and popularity of some workflow systems, but yet no one I know actually uses a workflow system for daily computational research. People programm in different scripting languages using their favoriate langauges and IDEs, execute them locally or submit them to cluster system with shell and other scripts, all without the use of a workflow system.</description>
