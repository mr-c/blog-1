Because of the needs to use libraries and tools in different languages and to execute them on
different systems such as clusters, bioinformaticians write a lot of scripts in different languages
and face many challenges in developing, running, managing, sharing, and reproducing bioinformatic
data analyses. Notably, 

1. **Management of scripts**: With increasing number of scripts, some in multiple versions, some shared
  among projects, some written for and executed on remote systems, it can be difficult to share data
  analysis with others, and reproduce prior data analyses later on.
2. **Analyze large datasets**: It is tedious and error-prone to write scripts to analyze larger and larger
  amount of data as more and more work is needed for the "execution" part of the analysis. Additional
  work includes but not limited to refactoring scripts for batch execution, creation and submission 
  of jobs, monitoring and fault recovery, and synchronization of data and results across system.

## Why workflow systems are not used in daily computational research

Scientific pipeline systems are supposed to alleviate these problems by streamlining the creation
and execution of data analysis workflows. However, after surveying all
[100+ workflow systems](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline) and trying
more than 10 of them, I realized that **the overhead of applying a workflow system in daily data
analysis is too high to help productivity**. 
As a matter of fact, as pointed out by [Loman and Watson, 2013, Nat Biotechnol](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2740),
using a workflow system for analyses that will be run only once, or not meant to be shared with or repeated
by others can decrease creativity and productivity.

In another word, workflow systems are designed for the repeated execution of mature workflows for
which a good deal of work is invested to help the users of workflows. They are not designed for daily
computational research where workflows are written for particular projects and are almost disposable.

## Pipelineitis is a treatable

Pipelineitis is a nasty disease but admitting the facts does not save us from all the aforementioned problems
we have in daily data analysis. Looking over and over at the key obstacles that prevent the application of
workflow systems in daily computational research, we realized that **narrowing the gap between environments
for interactive data analysis and workflow systems for batch data crunching would cure pipelineitis and
allow the use of workflow systems in daily computational research**. With this idea in mind, 
we developed [SoS (Script of Scripts)](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/),
which is a workflow engine with a multi-language notebook frontend. 
The following table summarizes the major features of SoS and how they help alleviate the symptoms 
of pipelineitis:

## An IDE for both interactive data analysis and workflow development

A complex workflow inevitably involves scripts in multiple languages. Existing workflow systems generally
do not provide an interactive environment for the development of these scripts. Even for workflow systems
that provide nice GUIs, the graphical interfaces are used to construct workflows from mature scripts, not
for the development of workflow steps. Consequently, users are required to develop workflow steps in
other environments before wrapping them to a workflow system.

**SoS Notebook is a multi-language IDE for the SoS workflow engine** that provides an interactive
environment for all stages of workflow development. As demonstrated in blog
posts [SoS Notebook: One Notebook, Multiple Kernels](https://vatlab.github.io/blog/post/sos-notebook/) and
[Combined power of SoS and SoS Notebook](https://vatlab.github.io/blog/post/power-of-sos-plus-sos-notebook/),
SoS Notebook allows you to:

* Develop scripts in different languages using multiple kernels,
  with added features such as string interpolation 
  (magic [%expand](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/doc/documentation/SoS_Magics.html#magic-expand))
  and line-by-line execution. 

* Convert scripts to SoS "actions" to be executed as (scratch) workflow steps. The "actions"
  are Python functions and can be debugged in the SoS kernel

* "Chain" the scratch workflow steps into SoS workflows by adding `input`, `output`, `depends`
  statements and section headers.

The SoS environment makes it easy to convert scripts developed in interactive
data analysis to a workflow which removes the biggest obstacle in the utilization 
of workflows in daily computational researach.

## Workflow syntax as "annotations" to Python scripts

SoS is extended from Python 3.6 so **a SoS script is essentially a Python script with
additional workflow specifications**. With Python being [one of the easiest scripting
language to learn](https://coderdojo.com/news/2015/03/20/top-5-programming-languages-for-beginners/) 
and [one of the most widely used scripting languages](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/),
SoS has a very smooth learning curve. As a matter of fact, SoS adds very few additional syntaxes
to Python and the follow table summarizes them all: 

Syntax | Example | Usage |
---|---| ---|
Script format of function call | <pre>sh:<br>  echo "I am sh"</pre> | Calling a Python function with multi-line script as first parameter |  
Section header | <pre>[step_10]</pre> | Define workflow steps |
Parameter definition | <pre>parameter: cutoff=5</pre> | Define command line argument |
Step input, output, and depends | <pre>input: "a.txt"</pre> | Define input, output, and dependent targets of steps |
Task | <pre>task: walltime='24h'</pre> | Define external tasks | 

As shown in the following figure, a SoS workflow can be created as verbatim inclusion of
scripts in different languages. The script can be annotated with additional workflow 
syntax to make use of more and more workflow features such as runtime signature and
external execution of tasks, but the workflow remains readable because the key parts
of the workflow, namely the included scripts, remain largely untouched.

## Benefits of using SoS for daily computational research

The moment you convert a script to a SoS workflow step, you have a working SoS workflow 
that can benefit from many of SoS' execution features.

### Runtime signature

SoS keeps track of runtime signatures so it will ignore a step if it has been executed
before. The signatures consist of input, output, dependent targets, statements and their
environments (e.g. used global variables) so a step would be re-executed if any of these
items has changed. The signatures are independent of step names and workflows so a step
would be ignored even if it belongs to multiple workflows.

What this means is that you can continuously revise and execute a workflow without worrying
about the re-execution of time-consuming steps, and without worrying about the execution
of relevant steps of the workflow with changing input or parameter.

### Remote execution

SoS allows the creation of  **tasks** from part of a workflow step. The tasks
are execution units that are independent of workflows and even file systems so they
can be executed locally or remotely in parallel (subject to number of concurrent running
tasks). With properly configured remote hosts, the same tasks could be executed locally
or on a remote host as separate processes, or be submitted to a PBS (Moab/torque, Slurm,
IBM LSF) system, or task queue systems such as [RQ](http://python-rq.org/). The
remote system does not have to share the same file system as the local host because
SoS automatically synchronizes input files, updates scripts, submits and monitors jobs,
and collects results. It even provides a job monitor system that is independent of
the underlying job systems.

The remote execution feature gives users easy access to all available computing
resources. It frees users from writing platform-specific codes for the submission
and monitoring of jobs and to synchronize input and result files across systems.
It also helps the readability and reproducibility of analysis because both local
and remote scripts are kept in the same notebook, without platform-specific job
management code.

### Powerful workflow systems

SoS supports both forward-style procedure-oriented and
makefile-style outcome-oriented workflows. The forward-style workflows are specified
as numerically ordered steps that will be executed sequentially (logically speaking),
and makefile-style workflows are specified as steps that provides targets that are
used by others. SoS also supports mixed style workflows (forward-style workflow
with dependencies satisfied by makefile-style steps) and nested workflows (execution
of subworkflows as function calls) which allows the creation of very complex
workflows that consists of hundreds of steps. The following figure illustrates the
DAG of a RNA Seq data analysis workflow.

In summary, SoS provides an environment for both interactive data analysis and batch
data crunching. It has a smooth learning curve because it is based on a widely used
scripting language (Python) with few additional syntaxes. It cures pipelineitis by
providing an easy transition from interactive to batch data analysis so users can
enjoy features such as runtime signature and remote execution with minimal effort.
At the same time, SoS provides a powerful workflow engine for the creation of complex
workflows so whereas you can complete most of your projects use SoS Notebook
and simple workflow features, your analysis can grow as your project grows, all without
leaving your familiar SoS environment.
