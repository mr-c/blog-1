title: "How does SoS compare with other workflow engines (Under development)"

Over [200 workflow systems](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language/wiki/Existing-Workflow-systems) have been developed to date.
Like any other software tools, many workflow systems are actively evolving with new features added from time to time. The goal of this blog post is to illustrate, by means of
comparison to some of the most popular workflow systems similar to SoS, **features and limitations of SoS as a conventional workflow system**.
It should be seen as a check-list of basic workflow features, in addition to the unique niche SoS places itself in the realm of workflow systems as explained
in the next section and in [other posts](https://vatlab.github.io/blog/).
We would very much appreciate it if you could [send us your comments](https://github.com/vatlab/blog/issues/10) if you believe more workflow engines or features should be compared, or if some comparisons are wrong or obsolete.


## How does SoS compare with SnakeMake, Nextflow, and Galaxy

In comparison to most workflow systems that are designed for "consumers" of workflows with emphases on efficient execution of well-crafted workflows with hidden details,
**SoS is designed for "developers" of workflows for ad hoc data processing with emphases on lowering the barrier of using workflows in daily computational research**.
The following tables compare basic features, workflow features, and built-in support for external tools and services between [SoS](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/),
[NextFlow](https://www.nextflow.io/), [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Bpipe](https://github.com/ssadedin/bpipe), and [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/). We exclude [CWL](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language) from the comparison table because CWL is a specification, not a workflow engine. It is designed to create portable workflows that can be executed by multiple workflow engines, and although its verbosity is almost in direct contrast with SoSâ€™ conciseness, it is required for its multi-engine design.

## Is SoS for you?

SoS is not for everyone. As a workflow system:

* If you are looking for a robust workflow system for large projects, the anser is likely no, at least for now.
* If you are looking for a script-less GUI-based workflow system, the answer is no.
* If you are a Jupyter user, the answer is most likely yes because SoS is embedded into SoS Notebook, which is by itself a polyglot notebook. You can enjoy all features of SoS Notebook and step into SoS only when needed.
* If you use multiple languages for daily data analysis, the answer is most likely yes.
